NonSteamLaunchers 🚀

This script installs the latest UMU/GE-Proton, installs NonSteamLaunchers under one unique Proton prefix folder in your compatdata folder path called "NonSteamLaunchers" and adds them to your Steam Library. It will also add the games automatically in real time.
So you can use them on Desktop or in Game Mode.
